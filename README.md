# housing_price_prediction_project
This is housing price prediction project from real estate industry.
## Problem Statement:

Consider that a real estate company has the data of real-estate prices in Delhi. The company wants to optimise the selling price of the properties, based on important factors such as area, bedrooms, parking, etc.

## Objective :
`To reduce negotiation time and improve closure for buyers/sellers by advising on potential sale/purchase price.`

## Downloadin Data 
You must have to download the dataset before running the iPython Jupyter Notebook.You can download the dataset on Kaggle.

## Requirents & Installation 
In order to run iPython Notebook.You'll need the following libraries.

* Numpy
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Scikit Learn 
## Installing Anaconda
The easiest way to install Jupyter as well as NumPy, Pandas, and matplotlib is to start with the Anaconda Python distribution.

Follow the installation instructions for Anaconda Python. We recommend using Python 3.7.

## Steps
* Understanding the business objective
* Data cleaning and preparation
### Preprocessing steps:
Identified the variables affecting house prices, e.g., area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.
* Test-train split
* Feature scaling
### Model Building:
Designed a linear regression model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables, such as the number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.
### Evaluation:
Evaluated the model, i.e. how well do these variables predict the house prices. 

 # Conclusion 
Deployed linear regression to purchase houses at a price below their actual value and flip them at a higher price.Created a predictive model to predict the actual value and decide whether to invest or not.
